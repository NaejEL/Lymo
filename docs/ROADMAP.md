# Lymo Project ‚Äî ROADMAP for LLMs

This roadmap is designed for LLMs assisting with the development of Lymo, a cross-platform videomapping software using Godot and GDScript. 

**üéØ Implementation Strategy:** Follow priority levels (P0-P3) and respect dependencies. Complete each priority level before moving to the next.

## üìã IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

### Priority Order & Dependencies
**P0 ‚Üí P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4**: Complete each priority level before advancing

### Key Dependencies
- **P0 Critical**: Surface interaction fixes must be completed first
- **P1 Essential**: Canvas improvements build on P0 surface system
- **P2 Professional**: Advanced mapping requires stable P1 foundation

- **P4 Polish**: Performance and advanced features come last

### Best Practices
- Always follow GUIDELINES.md
- Break down complex tasks into TODO lists
- Explain reasoning and choices in code and documentation
- Ask for clarification if requirements are unclear
- Test each priority level thoroughly before moving to next

### Current Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ **Foundation & MVP**: Complete
- üîÑ **P0 Core System**: Significant progress - major surface features completed

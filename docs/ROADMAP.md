---

## üöÄ P0: CORE SYSTEM FOUNDATION
*Complete these first - everything else depends on them*

### Critical UI/UX Fixes
- [x] Fix surface selection system - improve corner/edge detection precision
- [x] Fix surface dragging system - reduce bugs in surface movement  
- [x] Improve surface interaction feedback (hover states, selection indicators)
- [x] Add surface selection tolerance settings for easier interaction
- [x] Ability to drag surface using keyboard arrow (with same ctrl/shift helpers than for corners)
- [x] **Canvas Aspect Ratio Matching** - Editor canvas must reflect the aspect ratio (16:9, 4:3, etc.) of the selected output display for accurate preview
- [x] **Editor Resolution Scaling** - Fix low editor window resolution and implement proper scaling when transitioning to fullscreen output mode

### Essential File Operations
- [x] Add file dialogs for project save/load operations (FileDialogHelper utility created, consolidated dialog patterns)
- [x] Implement proper project file format validation (comprehensive validation system with data structure validation, version migration, and detailed error reporting)
- [x] Add keyboard shortcuts documentation (Help dialog fixed - now properly opens with comprehensive shortcuts)
- [x] Create application icon and branding assets (comprehensive branding system with Brand.gd constants, BrandApplier utility, professional SVG icon, and complete brand guidelines documentation)
- [x] Save user settings preferences( grid settings, Surface selection, transformation handles)

### Core Surface Features (Basic Functionality) - **COMPLETED**
- [x] Add surface transformation handles (rotation, scale) (implemented with centralized operations system)
- [x] Surface opacity/transparency controls (working in both editor and output)
- [x] Surface locking (prevent accidental editing - blocks mouse/keyboard interaction)
- [x] Surface naming and organization
- [x] Surface layering and depth ordering (Z-index controls with back/forward buttons)
- [x] Surface deletion with confirmation dialog
- [x] **Chroma Key (Green Screen) Effects** - Real-time GPU shader-based chroma key processing with color selection, threshold, and smoothness controls (working in both editor and output views)

### Video Alpha Channel Support - **BLOCKED (Godot Limitations)**
- [x] **FFmpeg Alpha-Aware Conversion** - VideoManager detects alpha channels and uses VP9/WebM format for videos with transparency, Theora/OGV for standard videos
- [x] **Alpha-Compatible Format Detection** - Comprehensive detection for alpha-capable source formats (WebM, ProRes 4444, MOV, etc.) with appropriate conversion paths
- ‚ùå **ProjectionSurface Alpha Rendering** - SurfaceRenderer is capable but receives corrupted purple/black artifacts instead of alpha data from Godot VideoStream
- ‚ùå **Alpha Compositing System** - Compositing logic works correctly but Godot VideoStreamWebm cannot provide proper alpha textures
- ‚úÖ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:** PNG sequence approach for alpha video support
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **LIMITATION:** Requires properly encoded source videos with actual alpha channel data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **PERFORMANCE:** CPU-only video decoding remains an issue for multiple high-resolution videos

**ÔøΩ STATUS:** Alpha video support implemented via PNG extraction pipeline, but source video quality dependent

---

## ‚úÖ P0.5: ALPHA VIDEO SYSTEM - COMPLETED
*Full alpha video support implemented via PNG sequence approach with intelligent caching*

### Key Features:
- **VP8/VP9 Alpha Support**: Proper decoder selection for alpha channel extraction
- **Smart Caching**: Prevents re-conversion of unchanged videos using JSON metadata
- **PNGSequencePlayer**: Drop-in replacement for VideoStreamPlayer with alpha support
- **Performance Optimized**: Frame-by-frame playback with minimal memory footprint
- **Future-Ready**: Foundation for upcoming C++ module-based approach

### **‚úÖ ALPHA VIDEO SUPPORT COMPLETED**
**Solution:** PNG sequence extraction pipeline for alpha video playback:
- ‚úÖ PNGSequencePlayer class with VideoStreamPlayer-compatible interface
- ‚úÖ FFmpeg PNG extraction with RGBA format preservation
- ‚úÖ Async processing with progress dialog integration
- ‚úÖ Smart frame caching and smooth 60fps playback
- ‚úÖ Unified rendering system supporting both regular videos and PNG sequences

### **‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT LIMITATIONS**
**Known Issues:** Alpha channel support depends on source video quality:
- ‚ùå Source WebM files may lack actual alpha data despite metadata flags
- ‚ùå VP8 with yuv420p format doesn't contain alpha channel information
- ‚ùå All video decoding remains CPU-only (no hardware acceleration)
- ‚ùå PNG sequences require more disk space than video files
- ‚ùå **Surface opacity controls don't work with PNG sequences** - requires PNGSequencePlayer opacity integration

### **üìã Future VideoStream Enhancement (Optional)**
*Hardware-accelerated alpha video system - deferred for later versions*
- [ ] **Phase 1-2: Core Implementation** (Weeks 1-4)
  - Hardware decoder architecture (NVDEC, QuickSync, VAAPI)
  - Cross-platform build system and dependency management
- [ ] **Phase 3: Godot Integration** (Weeks 5-6)  
  - VideoStreamPlayback implementation with threading
  - Alpha texture management and GPU memory optimization

**‚ö° BREAKTHROUGH + REALITY CHECK:** Godot's `draw_polygon()` IS GPU-accelerated BUT video texture mapping on N-sided polygons requires complex UV coordinate mathematics.

**üìã Professional Video Mapping Focus:**
- **Phase A (2-3 weeks):** Enhanced quadrilateral video surfaces with better perspective correction and transformations
- **Phase B (10-12 weeks):** VideoStream development + N-sided video texture mapping with triangulation algorithms
- **Core Focus:** Professional video projection mapping, not content creation
- **See:** `N-Sided_Polygon_Reality_Check.md` for technical analysis
